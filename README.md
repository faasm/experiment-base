# Experiments in the Faasm Ecosystem

This repository is the common entrypoint for all experiments in [Faasm](
    https://github.com/faasm).
It contains the boilerplate docker image for any benchmark with the
[Faasm runtime](https://github.com/faasm/faasm), the [Faabric](
https://github.com/faasm/faabric) messaging layer, or others.
